# Pargon - A suite of tools, free to access by anyone.
## What/Who we are:
:wave: Hello! We are an open-source free suite of tools, who's goal is to remake many paid tools, and make them accsessible to people who cannot afford to use the tools, as the are pay-to-use. Here, we belive that all tools should be completely free to use. If any tool uses pay for upgrade system, the upgrade option will not be encouraged by imposing a sensation of limitedness on the user, but instead as a option that grants additional uses to the application, as a bonus not as a way to unlock the said software. We hope you enjoy your time around here! \
Stay secure, safe, and free, The Paragon team.
## Services:
### ImageHero:
Like many other programs, such as Shutterstock, Istock, and Pngtree, we offer a wide range of images, free to download. But, unlike these programs, all the images are copyright-free, are free to download, and require **ZERO** attribution. You are allowed to download **AS MANY** images as you would like, and our Pro version simply allows you to access commenting on big image releases.
## Coming soon:
### AssetCloud:
An (extremely) simple soulution for finding 3d assets or tutorials. Web based, this tool can be used on any internet connected platform.
### Blocky text:
Designed for young coders learning text-based languages, this simple Python library makes syntax appear similar to Scratch, an MIT visual coding language.
